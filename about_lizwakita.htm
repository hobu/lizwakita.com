			<b><font size="5" color="#330033">About the Liz Wakita<br>
			</font>
			</b><font size="2" face="Arial">
Liz Wakita studied both painting and sculpture at
Colorado State University. Pursuing her passion for oil painting, she expanded
her studies through the years at the Loveland Academy, Colorado, in classes
given by James Biggers, Jeannie MacKenzie, Patti Andre, Howard Carr, and Joan
Potter, as well as other artists. Her style of painting varies from alla-prima
to involved under-painting techniques, which add a vibrancy of color to her
canvases. The artist has sold her original paintings at the Richard Schmid
Labor Day Art Auction in Rist Canyon, Colorado, as well as other parts of the
United States.

The artist enjoys being spontaneous, creative, and loves bold color. The Impressionists captured her heart with their colorful paintings and loose brushstrokes. Wakita self-studied the works of Monet and Renoir and duplicated some of their works, especially Monet&#8216;s hay bale and water lily paintings. Copying two of her favorite paintings, &#8220;Haystacks at Giverny&#8221; (Monet) and &#8220;Banks of the Seine at Asnieres&#8221; (Renoir), escalated her painting techniques and broadened her vision for her own work, which is reflected in her impressionistic-representational style of painting.
            <br>

In the artist&#8216;s words: &#8220;I want my artwork to convey the beauty of nature, to touch the viewer with the power of this land, to see the world as it is raw, and as the bounty of our lives. Nature stirs our senses, whether it is the wonder of its beauty, or the tranquility and inner peace it gives us, or the impact its powerful forces have on our lives&hellip;it is an integral part of all that we are.&#8221;
